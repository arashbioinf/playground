## Overview

This Wiki is structured to cover the following key areas:
1. **Data Analysis and Interpretation**: Focused on techniques and tools for analyzing biological data.
2. **Modeling and Simulation**: Focused on creating models and simulations of biological systems.
3. **Integrated Platforms and Tools**: Covering modern SaaS platforms that merge both fields, providing comprehensive tools for biological research.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the main sections, ensure you have a solid understanding of the [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md) based on your background in either computational or biological sciences.
